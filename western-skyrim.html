              Haafingar is located on a peninsula on the far northwest coast of Skyrim.
              It is the smallest Hold in the area and its coat of arms is the wolf's head.
              It is separated from Hjaalmarch by the Karth River and The Reach by mountains.
              Dragon Bridge, a bridge that crosses Karth River, is the only access to the Hold by road.
              Most of the Hold is rocky and mountainous, though the lower lying areas—including Dragon Bridge—are comprised of forests and hills.

              Solitude is the capital city of both Haafingar, and all of Skyrim.
              Currently ruled by Jarl Elisif the Fair, widow of the late High King Torygg, it is the headquarters of the Imperial Legion stationed in Skyrim.
              General Tullius commands the Imperial army from Castle Dour, while Elisif lives in the Blue Palace.
              Part of the reason for this is the defensible nature of Solitude itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solitude is a reinforced stronghold protected by the mountains surrounding it, the Karth River that the city towers above, and Fort Hraggstad overlooking the Sea of Ghosts in the west.
              It is also a major shipping port and important Imperial supply line.
              Most of the shipping is run by the Imperial-financed East Empire Company.
              Solitude is the only true cosmopolitan city in Skyrim.

              Hjaalmarch is found in northern Skyrim, at the mouth of the Karth River.
              Morthal, the capital of the Hold, lies near the center of the Hold.
              The surrounding Holds are Haafingar—separated by the Karth River—to the northwest, The Reach to the west, The Pale to the east, and Whiterun to the south.
              Much of the terrain is covered by wetlands, marshes, and swamps (which are infested with vampires).
              Its coat of arms is of a triskele.

              Morthal is a town shrouded in mystery.
              Its people are reclusive and wary of newcomers.
              Only a single lumber camp supports its weak economy.
              The Jarl, Idgrod Ravencrone, is among the most relaxed in Skyrim when it comes to taxation, but Hjaalmarch is the poorest of the nine Holds.
              Morthal is usually shrouded in a thick fog, making it foreboding to travelers approaching it, and the torches of the town glowing in the fog often look like wisps at a distance.
              Many travelers choose to steer clear of the place altogether.

              The Reach covers most of the western border of Skyrim.
              This region is composed of rugged highlands with few flat clearings, dotted with juniper trees and rich in valuable ores.
              The surrounding Holds are Haafingar to the north, Hjaalmarch to the northeast, Whiterun to the east, and Falkreath to the southeast.
              The capital of The Reach is the ancient Dwemer city of Markarth, where Jarl Igmund resides, and its coat of arms is a ram's head.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Reach is infamous for harboring the Forsworn, a clan of Reachmen fighting a long war of independence to retake Markarth from the Nords and free the Hold from Imperial authority.
              The Forsworn are the Reach's most common enemies and they dwell in the Reach highlands.
              With the constant threat of Forsworn attacks, the Reach is often considered the most dangerous Hold of Skyrim.

              Markarth is known for its rich silver mines that use convict labour, which are mostly owned by the influential Silver-Bloods family.
              It is in the far west of Skyrim, in the mountains of The Reach and west of the Karth River.
              As a result, the city has a good natural defense.
              Being a long distance from any other major city—with both main roads cutting through mountains, valleys, and rugged terrain—venturing to and from Markarth is one of the most treacherous trips for travelers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The city is split into two parts by a large running river.
              The Riverside is where the native Reachmen and the working district live while the Dryside houses all the Nord nobles and Silver-Bloods.
              The Jarl's palace, Understone Keep, is located at the top of the city, and contains the Hall of the Dead, the Dwemer Museum, and the Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site (where the internal part of the old Dwemer city remains in ruins).
              Most of the city's residents are unfriendly to outsiders.

              Whiterun is the central Hold of Skyrim and is the largest of the nine holds.
              It is named for the capital city of the hold, Whiterun. Its coat of arms is a horse's head, which can be seen on the banners inside Dragonsreach—the keep where Jarl Balgruuf the Greater resides.
              The landscape is mostly vast plains with sparse tundra and flowing rivers; however, its most striking landmark is the Throat of the World (the highest peak in Tamriel).
              High Hrothgar is an ancient monastery resting atop the mountain where the Greybeards dwell.
              Although High Hrothgar is located within the Hold, the Greybeards have no political ties to Whiterun.

              The area near the southern border and east of the river is mountainous.
              Whiterun appears to have stable security, but some residents complain that Whiterun's security is the worst in the province—which is a concern as this Hold is known for having many giant camps.

              In Whiterun, Nords live simple and harsh lives rooted in ancient ideas.
              Even the city's fortifications—wooden and stone palisade walls as well as the defensive advantage offered by its position on a large bluff that raises the city above the surrounding tundra—are antiquated.
              Nevertheless, its central location makes Whiterun the commercial heart of Skyrim.

              Falkreath is the second southernmost hold in Skyrim, after The Rift.
              It borders Cyrodiil to the south and Hammerfell to the west, with a single road leading to both provinces.
              Other than its capital—also named Falkreath—the other notable town in the hold is Helgen, the first settlement in Skyrim to be attacked by a dragon during the Dragon Crisis.

              This Hold is characterized by pine forests and described as being covered in a fine mist that makes it seem seasonless.
              In contrast to the rest of the Hold, the mountains rising above Falkreath are well above the snow line.
              The Hold’s most distinguishing geographic feature is Lake Ilinalta, which covers a large portion of the central region and acts as the source for the White River.

              Falkreath’s Jarl is Siddgeir and its coat of arms is a deer's head.
              The city lies in a valley near the center of the Hold, in the low-lying forest west of Helgen.
              Like the rest of Skyrim's woodland settlements, Falkreath's economy is very reliant on the production of lumber.
              It is one of the smaller major cities, with no walls surrounding it and not many buildings.
              The town is far more like a small farming village than a city.
