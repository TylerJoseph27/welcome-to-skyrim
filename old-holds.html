              The Pale is in the central northern area of Skyrim and extends to the northern coast where Dawnstar, the capital city of The Pale, is located.
              The surrounding Holds are Hjaalmarch to the west, Winterhold and Eastmarch to the east, and Whiterun to the south.
              Most of the region is treacherously cold with pine forests that stand against the harsh winds of the mountains, however the southernmost area near Whiterun contains grassy plains.
              Its coat of arms is a four-pointed star.

              Dawnstar is one of the major cities in Skyrim and is governed by Jarl Skald the Elder.
              It serves as a garrison town, but it is known for its rich mines and harbor.
              It is one of the colder settlements in Skyrim, along with Winterhold and Windhelm, as it resides in perpetual snow and ice.

              Winterhold is located on the northeast corner of Skyrim.
              It is an intensely cold region, and most of the Hold is covered in snowy tundra plains and high mountain ranges.
              Along the coast is a polar environment of glaciers and icebergs. The surrounding holds are The Pale to the west and Eastmarch to the south.
              Its Jarl is Korir and its coat of arms is a three-point crown.

              Winterhold, the capital of the hold of the same name, is a former major city located in northern Skyrim.
              Once a great city rivaling Solitude—another major city of Skyrim—in power and importance, Winterhold is now a shell of its former self due to the Great Collapse (a geological catastrophe that occurred before the events of the game).

              The College of Winterhold, a guild of mages in Winterhold, was not damaged by the Great Collapse which led many residents to believe the College was responsible for the event—although no proof has ever been found.
              Once a source of pride for Winterhold, the College is now a hated reminder of all that was lost.
              The town doesn’t get much business these days except for nobles looking for enchantments, or aspiring mages looking to learn at the College.

              Eastmarch is located along the eastern border of Skyrim.
              The surrounding holds are The Pale and Whiterun to the west, Winterhold to the north, and The Rift to the south.
              Its coat of arms is a bear's head. Central and south Eastmarch are volcanically active areas covered by plains with steaming gas that leak in between the cracks in the ground, as well as colorful, mineral filled bodies of water, and geysers.
              The far west of the Hold resembles the rest of central Skyrim and the north a mountainous tundra.
              The east is composed of the Velothi mountain range, which extends down to The Rift.

              It is the capital of Eastmarch and is also the oldest city in Skyrim, possibly the oldest city of man on Tamriel that is still standing.
              Ulfric Stormcloak is the Jarl of Windhelm and Eastmarch.
              Windhelm is the center of the Stormcloak faction as Ulfric is the leader of the rebellion.

              The Rift is the most southeasterly Hold of Skyrim.
              Major settlements include Riften, Ivarstead, and Shor's Stone.
              Its coat of arms is two crossed daggers and its capital city, Riften, is home to the Thieves Guild.
              Although the Jarl is Laila Law-Giver, the region is largely controlled by Maven Black-Briar.
